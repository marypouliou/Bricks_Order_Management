# Bricks_Order_Management

A program that manages orders of bricks has been developed.
 
Functionalities:
                1 -> Create Order
                2 -> Retrieve Order (Single of Multiple)
                3 -> Update Order   (Checking its Dispatch Status)
                4 -> Dispatch Order


mysql-connector-java and a mysql host are required to run the program.
Also, credentials of the database should be checked.

Thanks for your time and consideration.
